# 🚀 BizBuddy E2E Tests - Ready for Deployment

## ✅ Local Testing Complete

The E2E tests with authentication are working successfully:

- **Auth Capture**: Developer-friendly flow that auto-detects login
- **Token Valid**: 45 minutes remaining
- **Test Results**: Full auth flow test passes (13.1s)
- **Auth State**: 30 cookies + BizBuddy localStorage captured

## 🚀 Deployment to Railway

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: BizBuddy E2E tests with auth"
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Encode Auth State

```bash
npm run auth:encode
```

Copy the entire base64 output.

### Step 3: Railway Setup

1. Create new project on Railway
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Add environment variable:
   - Key: `BIZBUDDY_AUTH_STATE`
   - Value: [base64 string from step 2]

### Step 4: Deploy

Railway will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Install Playwright browsers
- Decode auth state from env var
- Run tests

## 📊 Test Scripts

- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:simple` - Run simple auth test (has timing issues)
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/full-auth-flow.spec.ts` - Run comprehensive test (recommended)

## 🔄 Auth Renewal

When token expires:
1. `npm run auth:refresh` locally
2. `npm run auth:encode`
3. Update Railway env var
4. Redeploy

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Auth State Security**: The `.auth/` directory is gitignored. Never commit auth state.
2. **Token Expiration**: Supabase tokens last ~1 hour
3. **Test Timing**: Some tests need longer waits for dashboard to fully load
4. **Railway Runs**: Tests run once per deployment, then service stops

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Push to GitHub
2. Set up Railway with auth state
3. Monitor test runs in Railway logs
4. Set up scheduled runs if needed (cron job to trigger deployments)
