# QA Engineer Agent Visualizer Demo

## Overview
This demo shows how a QA engineer uses the Enhanced Agent Visualizer to investigate a task that completed with warnings due to low confidence in the compliance check.

## User Story
**As a** QA Engineer  
**I want to** visualize how agents collaborate on tasks  
**So I can** identify issues and create regression tests  

## Key Findings

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Compliance check has only 70% confidence
- **Root Cause**: Cannot verify EIN with IRS database in demo mode
- **Impact**: Task completes but with warnings
- **Risk**: High - State registration status unknown

### Test Case Created
```javascript
describe('Onboarding Compliance Check', () => {
  it('should flag low confidence compliance checks', async () => {
    const task = await createOnboardingTask();
    await completeOAuth(task.id, userData);
    await submitBusinessInfo(task.id, businessData);
    
    const compliance = await getComplianceStatus(task.id);
    expect(compliance.confidence).toBeLessThan(0.8);
    expect(task.warnings).toContain('State registration pending');
  });
});
```

## Features Used

1. **Timeline View** - Visualized complete task flow across agents
2. **Context Diff** - Tracked how data evolved through the process
3. **Agent Reasoning** - Understood WHY decisions were made
4. **Risk Analysis** - Identified potential issues
5. **Test Builder** - Generated regression test automatically

## Screenshots

1. Dev Toolkit Home - Entry point for QA analysis
2. Agent Visualizer - Initial view with demo data
3. Timeline Swimlanes - Task flow visualization
4. Event Details - Investigating specific events
5. Context Evolution - Data changes over time
6. Agent Reasoning - Decision-making process
7. Compliance Details - Deep dive into low confidence
8. Test Builder - Creating regression tests
9. Test Export - Downloading for automation
10. Timeline Replay - Replaying the sequence

## Benefits for QA

- **Visual Understanding**: See exactly how tasks flow through agents
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify where and why issues occur
- **Test Generation**: Automatically create test cases from real scenarios
- **Regression Prevention**: Export tests for CI/CD integration
- **Team Communication**: Share visual evidence with developers

## Next Steps

1. Add this test case to regression suite
2. Create additional tests for edge cases
3. Monitor confidence scores in production
4. Set up alerts for low confidence decisions
