# üì∏ SCREENSHOT UPLOAD CHECKLIST FOR GITHUB ISSUES

### üî¥ PRE-UPLOAD VERIFICATION
- [ ] Screenshots captured from E2E tests
- [ ] Screenshots saved locally in test results directory
- [ ] Issue number identified (e.g., #31)

### üìÅ STEP 1: PREPARE DIRECTORY
```bash
cd /Users/gianmatteo/Documents/Arcana-Prototype-2/biz-buddy-e2e-tests
mkdir -p uploaded-screenshots/issue-{NUMBER}
```
- [ ] Directory created in e2e-tests repo
- [ ] Directory named with issue number

### üìã STEP 2: COPY SCREENSHOTS
```bash
cp {test-results-dir}/*.png uploaded-screenshots/issue-{NUMBER}/
```
- [ ] All relevant screenshots copied
- [ ] Files are in the correct directory

### üöÄ STEP 3: COMMIT AND PUSH
```bash
git add uploaded-screenshots/issue-{NUMBER}/
git commit -m "feat: Add screenshots for issue #{NUMBER}"
git push origin main
```
- [ ] Files added to git
- [ ] Commit message includes issue number
- [ ] Successfully pushed to GitHub

### ‚úÖ STEP 4: VERIFY URLS
```bash
# Test each URL before using
curl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianmatteo-arcana/biz-buddy-e2e-tests/main/uploaded-screenshots/issue-{NUMBER}/{filename}.png
```
- [ ] Each URL returns HTTP 200
- [ ] URLs use raw.githubusercontent.com
- [ ] URLs point to main branch

### üìù STEP 5: UPDATE ISSUE
```markdown
![Description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianmatteo-arcana/biz-buddy-e2e-tests/main/uploaded-screenshots/issue-{NUMBER}/{filename}.png)
```
- [ ] Using raw GitHub URLs (not placeholders)
- [ ] Each screenshot has a description
- [ ] Markdown syntax is correct

### üîç STEP 6: FINAL VERIFICATION
- [ ] Navigate to GitHub issue
- [ ] All screenshots are visible
- [ ] No broken image icons
- [ ] Screenshots properly demonstrate the feature/fix
